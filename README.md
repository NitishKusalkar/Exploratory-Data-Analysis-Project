*Summary statistics: 
                    - The code in the notebook calculates summary statistics for the Diamond Price Prediction Dataset,
                    In this notebook we discribe the data like we see the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles for each variable.
*Diamond prices:    
                   - The data includes a variable called "price," which appears to be the price of each diamond in the dataset.
                    The distribution of diamond prices is right-skewed, meaning that there are more diamonds on the lower end of the price spectrum than on the higher end. 
                    The most expensive diamond in the dataset costs around $18,823, while the cheapest diamond costs around $326.
Other variables:   
                   - The data also includes other variables, such as "carat," "depth," "table," and "cut." 
                     These variables likely correspond to physical characteristics of the diamonds, such as their weight, depth, size of the table facet, and quality of the cut.
                     
#Histogram
- Distribution of diamond prices: The histogram shows the distribution of prices for diamonds in the dataset. 
                                The x-axis shows the price of diamonds, and the y-axis shows the number of diamonds that have that price. 
                                The majority of diamonds fall in the lower price ranges, with fewer diamonds being more expensive. 
                                The most frequent price range is between $5,000 and $7,500.
                                
#Scatter Plot
- Positive correlation: There is a positive correlation between carat weight and price. This means that as the carat weight of a diamond increases, its price also tends to increase. 
                        However, the correlation is not perfect, and there are some diamonds that deviate from the general trend.
- Non-linear relationship: The relationship between carat weight and price is not linear. This means that the price does not increase at a constant rate as the carat weight increases.
                           Instead, the price increases at a slower rate for smaller diamonds and at a faster rate for larger diamonds.
- Outliers: There are a few outliers in the data, which are diamonds that have much higher or lower prices than other diamonds of similar carat weight.
          These outliers could be due to factors such as the diamond's cut, clarity, or color, which are not shown in this plot.
Overall, this scatter plot suggests that carat weight is an important factor in determining the price of a diamond, but it is not the only factor. Other factors, such as the diamond's cut, clarity, and color, can also have a significant impact on its price.

#Boxplot
- The quartiles of the data: The box extends from the first quartile (Q1) to the third quartile (Q3). The line in the middle of the box is the median (Q2).
- The spread of the data: The "whiskers" extend from the ends of the box to the most extreme data points that are not considered outliers.
*Outliers: Data points that fall outside the whiskers are considered outliers.
*Price distribution: The median price is highest for Ideal cut diamonds and lowest for Fair cut diamonds.
- The price distribution is also narrower for Ideal and Premium cut diamonds, and wider for Good, Very Good, and Fair cut diamonds.
- This means that Ideal and Premium cut diamonds tend to have a more consistent price, while the prices of Good, Very Good, and Fair cut diamonds are more variable.
*Outliers: There are a few outliers in the data, particularly for Good and Fair cut diamonds. These outliers represent diamonds that have a much higher or lower price than other diamonds of the same cut.
